# How to install `git` with posh-git in Powershell on a Windows Computer

What you need:
* powershell - Windows 10 terminal environment
* chocolatey - Package manager for Windows 10
* `git` - Source Control Manager
* posh-git - Powershell syntactic sugerer
* a text editor - for editing configuration files.

----------
## Bonus Round: Install [Hyper] for tabbed cli

[Hyper] is a terminal emulator that allows you to pick the shell you want to use while allowing you to have features the native powershell cli doesn't offer such as more comprehensive theming and tabbed multiplexing.
