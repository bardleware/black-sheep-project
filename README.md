# Black Sheep Project
*Migrate from macOS to Windows 10 for Web development*

While working away at my daily grind, I came to a project that forced me to need to develop in a Windows 10 development environment. I had to learn how to set up git, install nodejs without nvm (honestly not the most complicated thing), and not lose my sanity as it seemed I would from all the cringes from my team lead when I told him that I was going to need to work on a Windows PC.

I learned how to set up git, install and confirgure my favorite editor, install nodejs, and keep all my sanity. As it turns out, developing on a Windows 10 PC is not as difficult as I thought. I even thought I'd try and install the `gcc` using a [tutorial][1] I found online to see if I could get `C` code to work. Remarkably, I came away from that unscathed and now have a way I can compile and run `C` code.

In this tutorial series I will show you how to:
* Set up powershell as your CLI
* Installl **Chocolatey**
* Install and configure git scm
* Use Chocolatey to install
  * development enviroments
  * text editors and IDEs

...All on a Windows computer
